# Teletraan

Teletraan is a centralized security command system designed for high-performance desktop environments. It provides a unified interface for monitoring surveillance feeds, managing system logs, and coordinating security operations from a single dashboard.

The project focuses on low-latency state synchronization and a highly responsive tactical UI. It is built to maintain a persistent connection to remote hardware nodes while providing a streamlined administrative experience.

## Key Functionality

- **Centralized Surveillance Management**: A multi-feed matrix for monitoring integrated camera systems and hardware sensors.
- **Automated Synchronization**: A background update system that ensures all nodes remain on the latest stable build with minimal downtime.
- **Security Event Logging**: A high-velocity log aggregator designed for real-time situational awareness and event tracking.
- **Administrative Control**: A secure entry point for system administrators to manage credentials and monitor network health.

The system is architected as a standalone desktop application, optimized for stability and long-session reliability in security monitoring stations.
